## What is version control in Microsoft Word and how do you view a version history?
Version control in Microsoft Word is a way to track and manage changes to a document over time. One way to do it is by clicking "Save As" and using different filenames for each version. Another way is by using the "Version History" feature in Microsoft Word, which shows a sidebar with all your versions and lets you open them as read-only documents. 

To view version history in Word, there are different ways depending on the file location and the application used. One common method is to click the File menu and select Version history or Info, then choose See version history or Version history. Another method is to right-click on the space between the file name and date, and select Version history from the menu. A version history section or dialog will open on the right side of the window or in a separate window, where versions can be viewed, restored, or deleted.

To use version control in Word for OneDrive, you can follow these steps:

1. Store your documents in either OneDrive or in a SharePoint Library.
2. Turn on AutoSave to automatically save your work.
3. Share documents by inviting someone to the library, or providing a link rather than sending a discrete copy of the document.
4. Work with others to co-author a document at the same time.
5. To view version history, go to Office.com and choose OneDrive. Navigate to your file and choose the three dots next to the file you want and select “Version history”.
6. To restore a previous version of a file, sign in to OneDrive, select the file that you want to restore to an earlier version, right-click, then select Version history.

You can also limit the number of versions of a document by customizing the versioning settings in OneDrive Online page.

## Do you have any tips regarding using the autosave function please? It appears that whenever I use autosave, the physical copy of the document disappears from my laptop and I can only access/edit it via the online version of Word. Is there a way to keep the physical file on my hard drive and have Microsoft Office create an 'auto backup' on OneDrive?

To enable autosave in Microsoft Word, you can open the File tab and select Options, then click Save and check the box for Autosave or AutoRecover. To keep a physical copy of the document on your laptop and have Microsoft Office create an 'auto backup' on OneDrive, you can store your documents in either OneDrive or in a SharePoint Library, turn on AutoSave to automatically save your work, and share documents by inviting someone to the library, or providing a link rather than sending a discrete copy of the document. You can also limit the number of versions of a document by customizing the versioning settings in OneDrive Online page.

There is also an app for OneDrive on Windows. You can download and install the Microsoft OneDrive app for PC from the Microsoft Store.
