# Session 1

## Before you start writing:
### The University's thesis regulations.
The University of East Anglia has [regulations](https://my.uea.ac.uk/divisions/research-and-innovation/postgraduate-research/regulations/rdpd-3-submission-and-presentation-of-theses) for the appearance of a research thesis or dissertation. This module will refer to these regulations for a number of activities. Although there is some choice around formatting, you should ensure that your work complies with requirements in Research Degree Policy Document 3 (RDPD 3).

### Planning your document.
One long document can be difficult to navigate, slow to search and save, and prone to corruption, particularly if it includes images and diagram. Many students prefer to work in separate files and combine these later in the process. This is the process that we will follow on this module.

### Tips for backing up your work.
It is inevitable that you will produce different versions of sections of your thesis or dissertation. When you are working on versions of Word files, we recommend deciding on a naming convention for them. The simplest example is simply the name of the file followed by today's date. For example, 'lit_review_20231113.docx'. Using the date format of year, month an day will make the name of document easier to sort chronologically. However, if date is more important than the document name, then you can place date before the name. For example, '20231113_lit_review.docx'.

Version control is helpful, but it does not prevent you losing data. This will depend on the storage location. It is useful to store the versions of files in multiple locations rather than on the hard drive of your device or in one medium, such as a memory stick or external hard drive. The most secure option is the University's OneDrive, which you can access on different devices. This often allows you to autosave your work as you make changes. Periodically, however, you may wish to take a snapshot of files using the [Windows backup feature](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-your-windows-pc-87a81f8a-78fa-456e-b521-ac0560e32338) or the [Mac OS Time Machine feature](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201250).


- Direct formatting versus styles.
- Style panel.
- h1, h2, h3 examples.
- Advantages of styles over direct formatting:
	- quick to apply
	- consistent
	- easy to change
	- styles provide other features - use of navigation pane
- Modifying styles - font style and size, alignment, etc.
- Use of the format menu in the styles, such as indentation and spacing in heading styles.
- Creating a new style - predefined formatting - creating a new for a style and what to do with subsequent styles.
- Applying numbered headings (multilevel list).
- Modifying numbered headings.
