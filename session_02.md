# Session 2
## Page layout:

### Changing page margins.
In this second session, we will look in more detail at page layout. There are a number of document settings that are required as part of the the University's Thesis Regulations (RDPD 3). The first concerns page margins, which in the Regulations are defined as follows: 'to allow for printing, where requested by the examiners, the margin on the left-hand side of the page shall be not less than 40mm. Other margins shall be not less than 15mm'. Ideally, you should set the page margins before you write a document, so that you are used to the layout and print preview, but you can adjust margins in an existing document.

Open the file 'bard_thesis.docx'. On the toolbar, click on 'Layout' then 'Margins' and select 'Custom Margins'. Change the dimensions of the margins as follows:

`- Top: 1.5 cm
- Bottom: 1.5 cm
- Left: 4 cm
- Right: 1.5 cm`

Now, click on the 'Multiple Pages' option. If you are printing your document double-sided, then select 'Mirro Margins'. Click on 'OK' to save the new settings. You will notice that the text on page 1 has moved to the right. If you have mirrored the margins, page 2 will have text that has moved to the left. This allows for the 'gutter', which is the extra space on a page that allows for binding.

### Headers, footers and page numbers.
Although headers and footers are not specifically mentioned in the Regulations, pagination is: 'page numbers shall be visibly clear of the text'. Inserting a page number is very simple in Word. From the toolbar, just click on 'Insert' then in the 'Header & Footer' section, select 'Page Number' to reveal some options. In most cases, page numbers will be positioned on the bottom right of the page, but you can choose another location.

However, if you have mirrored the margins, then the page number might end up in the gutter. Ideally, this needs to be on the outer edge. one way to do this is select 'Different Odd & Even Pages' in the toolbar and to manually adjust the number positions.

Next, click on 'Footer' and select 'Edit Footer'. On page 1 (the odd footer), ensure that the page number is aligned to the right margin. On page 2 (the even footer), click on 'Insert' and  'Page Number' again and ensure that this is aligned to the left margin. Click on 'Close Header & Footer' to view the document. All of the page numbers should now be aligned to the outer edge, avoiding the gutter (inner edge) of each page.

Please note that the default style for page numbers is Calibri (Body) 12 point. If you would like to change this to match the font of the document text, right click on the page number on page 1 and select a new font. Repeat this process for page 2. The changes will be applied to the whole document.
