# Session 2
## Page layout:

### Changing page margins.
In this second session, we will look in more detail at page layout. There are a number of document settings that are required as part of the the University's Thesis Regulations (RDPD 3). The first concerns page margins, which in the Regulations are defined as follows: 'to allow for printing, where requested by the examiners, the margin on the left-hand side of the page shall be not less than 40mm. Other margins shall be not less than 15mm'. Ideally, you should set the page margins before you write a document, so that you are used to the layout and print preview, but you can adjust margins in an existing document.

Open the file 'bard_thesis.docx'. On the toolbar, click on 'Layout' then 'Margins' and select 'Custom Margins'. Change the dimensions of the margins as follows:

- Top: 1.5 cm
- Bottom: 1.5 cm
- Left: 4 cm
- Right: 1.5 cm

Now, click on the 'Multiple Pages' option. If you are printing your document double-sided, then select 'Mirro Margins'. Click on 'OK' to save the new settings. You will notice that the text on page 1 has moved to the right. If you have mirrored the margins, page 2 will have text that has moved to the left. This allows for the 'gutter', which is the extra space on a page that allows for binding.
