# Session 2
## Page layout:

### Changing page margins.
In this second session, we will look in more detail at page layout. There are a number of document settings that are required as part of the the University's Thesis Regulations (RDPD 3). The first concerns page margins, which in the Regulations are defined as follows: 'to allow for printing, where requested by the examiners, the margin on the left-hand side of the page shall be not less than 40mm. Other margins shall be not less than 15mm'. Ideally, you should set the page margins before you write a document, so that you are used to the layout and print preview, but you can adjust margins in an existing document.



### Headers, footers and page numbers.


### All about section breaks.
So this is the same example thesis that we've been using throughout the, uh, the demonstrations here. And I'm going to just turn off the navigation. But I'm going to leave on the Show Hide paragraph formatting marks because these, um, these are really useful when you're dealing with section breaks. Because they allow you to actually see the section breaks. And it can really help to work out what's going on. So let me scroll down through the document. And the first thing we want to do is to insert a section break. So section breaks are used to create different layouts within a document. So you can have different content in the headers and footers or change the page orientation in different sections. So in this case, I'm going to put in a section break between the pre-pages, which are the contents page and the, um, uh, the summary and so forth. And the start of Chapter 1, here. So at the moment, at the bottom of the contents page, we have just a simple page break. So a page break is a bit of formatting that tells Word, "Start a new page here". I'm going to delete that. And instead of the page break, I'm going to put in a section break. So you find the section breaks on the Layout tab in the Breaks menu. So there's the page break that we've just deleted. You can also get column breaks. So if your Word document uses columns, a column break will say "start a new column here". And text wrapping breaks, which are to do with wrapping text around images in your document. But the section breaks, you'll see we actually have 4 different ones here that we could use. The first one is 'section break: next page', which says "start a new section and a new page here". 'Section break: continuous', says "start a new section, but don't start a new page". 'Section break: even page' says "start a new section and a new page, but the next page after the section break will be an even-numbered page". And 'odd page', then, is "start a new section and a new page, but the next page after the section break will be an odd-numbered page". So these are really used if you want the next section to start on a specific page number. And probably the most commonly used one would be this odd page one. 


### Creating a landscape page within your document.


### Double-sided printing.
So if you had set up your document and you are going to print it double-sided. The convention is that a new chapter will always start on the right-hand page, um, and the right-hand page is always an odd-numbered page. So in that case, before a new chapter started, you would use a 'section break: odd page', and that would make sure that the new chapter started on an, on an odd page which when printed double-sided, would be the right-hand page. Um, if you're not going to print your document or if you're going to print it single-sided, you don't need to worry about that. So I'm just now I'm just going to insert a 'section break: next page'. And you'll see there we go. If I scroll up, I can see it's there at the bottom of the contents page. I've got a section break and then chapter one starts here. I've got an extra line break which I don't need. So I'm just going to press the Delete key to get rid of that. Another thing that's really useful if you're working with section breaks, as well as having the show/hide formatting on, is to add the sections the bottom of your, um, of your word layout here. To the bottom toolbar. If you can't already see, um, a little bit that says "Section: 1". You can right-click on that toolbar and then you can choose which, which parts to show. So at the moment I've got the, um, the page number, the formatted page number, and the section. So if I untick section, it would disappear. But at the moment it's ticked, so I can see it. That's good. So the contents is in section one, and then after the section break, chapter one is section two. So, next thing I want to do is, I want to add text to the header of my document. And, um, the reason that I've inserted those section breaks is because I want to have different text in the header, in the pre-pages than in the chapter one. Okay. So pre-pages is section one, chapter one is section two, different header and footer text in both of them.

## Adding content
### Tables.

### Images.
So for this demonstration, I'm going to use the thesis to document here, which you can download. You can find in the practise files folder on I'm on the documents catalogue. So this is the thesis to document which has been set up to follow on from the first demonstration. So first of all, we're going to look at inserting an image. When you insert an image in Word, they can be inline or floating. Inline images are treated as if they were a character and the paragraph. Whereas floating images can move anywhere in the document and the texts will wrap around them. 

So I'm just going to move to page seven of the document here. And we will insert an image. So you can see here, we already have an image here. But we want to put one in here. To insert. It will go to the Insert tab and choose pictures and find the image which was in that practise files folder. Here we go. So we've already got embedded figures. We want to put in mental rotation. C, That's just put the image where the cursor was in the Word document. And because the image selected, I have this layout options button. If I click on that, I can see what layout options I have. So the ones at the top, um, there was only one in line with text. That is the inline option, which is what the image currently is. Then underneath we have with text wrapping, these are the floating options. The inline with text option. Let me just close that for a moment. Means that you can drag the image where you want, but it's always part of the, um, the word text as it were. So there are actually put it within a word in that sentence. I'm going to put it back on its own line there. If I turn on the Show Hide marks, you can see that that image is actually on its own paragraph. There's the end of paragraph mark there between the sentence and this sentence. 

Um, this file is fairly straightforward way of doing it, and it is actually the way of inserting images that's probably going to give you the fewest problems. So it's the one that we recommend. Unless you actually need floating images. You can set up the paragraph here so you can set up the paragraph alignment with the image selected the moment it is a left aligned. But if we wanted, we could centre it or even right align it if we wanted to, just as you count with text. The other option, if we choose, is to have text wrapping. There's a few different ones here. So how closely around the image the text wrapping goes, whether it just drops the bottom and top of the image, whether it goes behind it or whether it goes in front. Let's just choose the first one, the square text wrapping around the image. 

You see when I chose that, it did change the text that comes after the image has started wrapping around the side. And now if I move it, it's much more flexibility about how I move it. You can say, even though it's a floating image, it does have this little paragraph anchor, which anchors it to one of the texts paragraphs. So that can help too. If you run into problems with images, floating images can be problematic. They sometimes don't turn it where you expect them to. Sometimes word decides that it can't possibly float in the place where you want it. And it's got to move on to the next page or something like that. So knowing about the paragraph anchor can be helpful in those circumstances to work out what's going on. 

### Captions.
But I'm going to leave this image at the moment just as the inline with text option and then put it there where it was on its own paragraph. And I'm going to align that paragraph. I left. You can also use words built-in options to insert a caption for an image. And to do that, first of all, you select the image, then you go to the References tab and you click Insert Caption. Then you get this little window that comes up. And this is one of the advantages of using words built-in captions feature rather than just typing the caption text underneath the image. First advantage there is kind of obvious. It will number the captions for you. If you move the image is about or if you insert more images before ones that are already there, it will update all the numbering for you and keep it on track. This caption is saying this is figure 1.1. So that's Figure one in chapter one. If you're not getting the chapter number there, you can click on numbering and select include chapter number. Then we want to type the caption title. 

So this was a mental rotation test. And then underneath you have a few options. So you can say what sort of caption label you want. This is a figure, so that's correct, but you also have an option there for equation and an option for table. If you wanted to caption something that wasn't a figure equation or table, you could put in a new label using the button here. You can also choose the position for figure. It defaults to below the selected item because that's the convention. But if you prefer, you could put the caption above the selected item. I'm going to leave it as below. And then I'm going to say, Okay, here, you see what it's done is it's put the caption there below the figure on its own paragraph. And also, if we go and have a look at the styles, you'll see that it's formatted the caption texts in its own style. 

So this could be modified or updated just as we showed you in the first demonstration. You could go in and change the caption style and that would change the appearance of the text for all the captions in the document. So that's kinda the second advantage of using words built-in captions. The third one is that you can actually produce a table of figures with them, which will show you at the end of the course today. So Word can create a table with all the caption text and the pages that the captions appear on. And that can then act as a table of figures. One little gotcha with the captions. They're fine. If you're, if you've got inline images like this one as they just appear on the, on the, um, the line below the image. 

If you've got floating images, so let's just make this image a floating image and then caption it. So the References tab and insert caption. You see it's got the number correct. This is embedded figures task. I'm going to leave everything else the same. In this case. And the caption is put into a text box. So it's not just a paragraph of text, is actually a text box which floats around dislike the image itself does. I'm just going to undo that to put it back exactly where it asks to begin with. Because I wanted to show you. If you want to move the image, then it's a good idea to group the caption and the image together so that they both move together and they stay together. 

So the, the caption textbox is already selected. I'm going to press the Shift key on my keyboard and click on the image. And then I'm going to go up to either of these format menus that have appeared and choose Group, group, objects, group. And that just then puts them both together. So if you do need to move that image, you can drag the whole thing rather than having to move the image itself and then move the caption and get it all lined up again.
